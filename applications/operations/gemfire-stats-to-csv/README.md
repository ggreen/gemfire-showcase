# GemFire Stats To CSV

This application prints useful [GemFire](https://gemfire.dev/) statistics to a CSV file.

This application only prints the [Most useful statistics](https://community.broadcom.com/education/blogs/migration-user/2021/07/01/the-most-useful-statistics-for-troubleshooting-vmware-gemfire-deployments) for troubleshooting  GemFire Deployments.

## Getting Started

This application has been tested with the following

- Java 17
- Gradle 8.4

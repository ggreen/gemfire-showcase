# Introduction to `gfsh` (GemFire Shell)

GemFire provides a command-line tool called **`gfsh` (GemFire Shell)**.  
It is used to manage, configure, and interact with a GemFire cluster. With `gfsh`, you can:

- Start and stop locators and servers
- Create and manage regions
- Perform data operations (put, get, query, remove)
- Monitor and troubleshoot the system

---

## **Starting `gfsh`**

`gfsh` is included in your GemFire installation.  
To start the shell, navigate to the GemFire `bin` directory and run:

Start Gfsh in a container

```shell
deployment/scripts/podman/gfsh.sh
```

Once started, youâ€™ll see a prompt like:

gfsh>


---

## **Connecting to a Locator**

Before interacting with the cluster, connect `gfsh` to a running **locator**:

```gfsh
connect --locator=gf-locator[10334]
```

If the connection is successful, you will see:

Successfully connected to: JMX Manager [host=gf-locator, port=1099]

## **Cluster Member Operations**

### **1. List All Members**

To list all members (locators and servers) connected to the cluster:

```gfsh
list members
```


**Example Output**:

```shell
Member Name | Host | Process ID
locator-1 | local | 12345
server-1 | local | 23456
server-2 | local | 34567
```
